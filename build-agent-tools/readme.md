# Intro

This project creates a dev container prepared with the TF, GO and other dependencies. This container image is then made available in the ACR created in the bootstrapping and then used to run the workflows in GitHub Actions.

>Note: before building this image, create an empty subdirectory named `configuration` alongside the Dockerfile.
